# PReQual - Pull Request Dataset Analyzer

## Installation

### 1 - Sonar CLI Runner

```bash
# Pulling the docker image
docker pull  sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli
```

The docker container will be launch automatically by the script during the analysis.

### 2 - Setup a Docker network

```bash
docker network create sonar-net
```

### 3 - SonarQube

```bash
# Pulling the docker image
docker pull sonarqube

# Run the image
docker run -d --name sonarqube -e SONAR_ES_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKS_DISABLE=true -p 9000:9000 --network=sonar-net sonarqube:latest
```

Once the image is running, the admin password must be reset by going on Sonar's [main page](http://localhost:9000). 
The web interface run on `http://localhost:9000`, but it will be different if you run the analysis on a distant server.

### 4 - Setup Token access

Once SonarQube is running, a global access token must be set:

- Got to `My Account` then to `security`
- Create a new token by selecting `Global Analysis Token`. 
- Copy the newly created token, and paste it in the .env file of the analyzer root folder (a `.env.example` is available for reference).

## Run the script locally

To run the analyzer script:

```bash
go run main.go -repo organization/repository 
```

Two arguments can be passed: 
- `-repo organization/repository`, to precise on which GitHub repository the analysis will be run.
  - `organization` is the GitHub organization name
  - `repository` is the GitHub repository name
- [Option] `-workspace my-workspace`, to precise the workspace folder for the analysis, the default workspace is `./tmp` in the root script folder.
- [Option] `-metrics flag1,flag2,...`, to precise which SonarQube flags should be included in the analysis, the default is `Cognitive complexity` and `Cyclomatic complexity`. The available flags are listed in the next section, the extended list of flags can be found on SonarQube's official documentation.


### Sonar Flags

The SonarQube analysis can be customized by passing flags to the script.
- Cyclomatic complexity -> `complexity`
- Cognitive complexity -> `cognitive_complexity`
- Code smells -> `code_smells`
- Development cost -> `development_cost`
- Duplicated lines -> `duplicated_lines`
- Number of lines of code -> `ncloc`
- Software quality maintainability rating -> `software_quality_maintainability_rating`


## Run the script on distant server (Currently unavailable)

### 1 - Build the docker image

```bash
docker build -t prequal .
```

### 2 - Run the image

```bash
docker run --rm --name PReQual --network=sonar-net --env-file .env -v $(pwd)/analysis:/workspace -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock prequal -repo organization/repository
```

Two arguments can be passed:
- `-repo organization/repository`, to precise on which GitHub repository the analysis will be run.
    - `organization` is the GitHub organization name
    - `repository` is the GitHub repository name

For this method, a GitHub CLI token must be provided in the `.env` file.
